# CryptoCurrencyPrices
An app that displays the various prices of cryptocurrencies from multiple sources in one place.

## Notes:
I am using Java, as it has a built-in UI framework, as well as it's one of the languages I know best.

## References:
This project makes use of the JSON Simple project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple). I do not own this work.
